## How to use this sandbox:

```
$  vim -u my-vimrc
```
or

```
$  mvim -u my-vimrc
```

Then in normal mode:

```
:PlugInstall
:source ./my-vimrc
```

If you are on OSX, you can also click the file `_clickme-to-open.command` to launch the sandbox. This `.command` file will execute:

```
mvim -u my-vimrc main.txt
```
